As long as we had fun, no match was impossible!"]

Filled with toxic chemicals, they are actually the biggest danger to our coastlines right now. Sand sifting machines, the conventional tools for large-scale beach-cleaning, cannot remove such small trash effectively because of net limitations. Denser nets would filter out seashells and organic life, too. That's why we designed Litore.",
    "description": ["Litore is a friendly and inviting crab-like robot on an ambitious mission: to effectively rid beaches of cigarettes and other small waste with its two tele-operated arms. Through the 360 camera on the front, its operator can control it from a distance to pick up and analyze trash around. Litore comes equipped with a built-in trashcan, so beachgoers are encouraged to help contribute to safer and cleaner beaches.", 
    "Litore was my Robotics minor project, commissioned by <b>Techtics</b> in collaboration with <b>TU Delft</b>. Since it is an interfacultary minor, I did this project with 6 other students from Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Enginering, and Computer Science. Together we worked under the team name <b>Robust</b>. As the team's sole Industrial Designer, I was responsible for Litore's exterior design, human-robot-interaction and user experience, ethics, business aspects, and promotional material such as branding, renders & videos. In addition, I was in charge of the stream setup during the live demo shown in the video below.", "", ""]
